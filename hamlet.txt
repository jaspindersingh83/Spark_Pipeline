hamlet@1022
hamlet@1023	SCENE I	Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
hamlet@1071
hamlet@1072
hamlet@1073		[FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO]
hamlet@1121
hamlet@1122	BERNARDO	Who's there?
hamlet@1144
hamlet@1145	FRANCISCO	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
hamlet@1199
hamlet@1200	BERNARDO	Long live the king!
hamlet@1229
hamlet@1230	FRANCISCO	Bernardo?
hamlet@1250
hamlet@1251	BERNARDO	He.
hamlet@1264
hamlet@1265	FRANCISCO	You come most carefully upon your hour.
hamlet@1315
hamlet@1316	BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
hamlet@1377
hamlet@1378	FRANCISCO	For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
hamlet@1435		And I am sick at heart.
hamlet@1460
hamlet@1461	BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?
hamlet@1496
hamlet@1497	FRANCISCO	Not a mouse stirring.
hamlet@1529
hamlet@1530	BERNARDO	Well, good night.
hamlet@1557		If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
hamlet@1596		The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
hamlet@1642
hamlet@1643	FRANCISCO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
hamlet@1698
hamlet@1699		[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
hamlet@1730
hamlet@1731	HORATIO	Friends to this ground.
hamlet@1763
hamlet@1764	MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.
hamlet@1800
hamlet@1801	FRANCISCO	Give you good night.
hamlet@1832
hamlet@1833	MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:
hamlet@1872		Who hath relieved you?
hamlet@1896
hamlet@1897	FRANCISCO	Bernardo has my place.
hamlet@1930		Give you good night.
hamlet@1952
hamlet@1953		[Exit]
hamlet@1961
hamlet@1962	MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!
hamlet@1989
hamlet@1990	BERNARDO	Say,
hamlet@2004		What, is Horatio there?
hamlet@2029
hamlet@2030	HORATIO	A piece of him.
hamlet@2054
hamlet@2055	BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
hamlet@2107
hamlet@2108	MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
hamlet@2164
hamlet@2165	BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.
hamlet@2195
hamlet@2196	MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
hamlet@2241		And will not let belief take hold of him
hamlet@2283		Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
hamlet@2331		Therefore I have entreated him along
hamlet@2369		With us to watch the minutes of this night;
hamlet@2414		That if again this apparition come,
hamlet@2451		He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
hamlet@2493
hamlet@2494	HORATIO	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
hamlet@2533
hamlet@2534	BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;
hamlet@2560		And let us once again assail your ears,
hamlet@2601		That are so fortified against our story
hamlet@2642		What we have two nights seen.
hamlet@2673
hamlet@2674	HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
hamlet@2701		And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
hamlet@2742
hamlet@2743	BERNARDO	Last night of all,
hamlet@2771		When yond same star that's westward from the pole
hamlet@2822		Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
hamlet@2873		Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
hamlet@2916		The bell then beating one,--
hamlet@2946
hamlet@2947		[Enter Ghost]
hamlet@2962
hamlet@2963	MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
hamlet@3024
hamlet@3025	BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
hamlet@3081
hamlet@3082	MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
hamlet@3134
hamlet@3135	BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
hamlet@3191
hamlet@3192	HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
hamlet@3247
hamlet@3248	BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
hamlet@3279
hamlet@3280	MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
hamlet@3312
hamlet@3313	HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
hamlet@3369		Together with that fair and warlike form
hamlet@3411		In which the majesty of buried Denmark
hamlet@3451		Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3505
hamlet@3506	MARCELLUS	It is offended.
hamlet@3532
hamlet@3533	BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
hamlet@3581
hamlet@3582	HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
hamlet@3632
hamlet@3633		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@3647
hamlet@3648	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
hamlet@3690
hamlet@3691	BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
hamlet@3745		Is not this something more than fantasy?
hamlet@3787		What think you on't?
hamlet@3809
hamlet@3810	HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
hamlet@3858		Without the sensible and true avouch
hamlet@3896		Of mine own eyes.
hamlet@3915
hamlet@3916	MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?
hamlet@3969
hamlet@3970	HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:
hamlet@4002		Such was the very armour he had on
hamlet@4038		When he the ambitious Norway combated;
hamlet@4078		So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
hamlet@4124		He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
hamlet@4166		'Tis strange.
hamlet@4181
hamlet@4182	MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
hamlet@4239		With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
hamlet@4286
hamlet@4287	HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
hamlet@4342		But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
hamlet@4385		This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
hamlet@4433
hamlet@4434	MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
hamlet@4492		Why this same strict and most observant watch
hamlet@4539		So nightly toils the subject of the land,
hamlet@4582		And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
hamlet@4625		And foreign mart for implements of war;
hamlet@4666		Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
hamlet@4716		Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
hamlet@4759		What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
hamlet@4805		Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
hamlet@4855		Who is't that can inform me?
hamlet@4885
hamlet@4886	HORATIO	That can I;
hamlet@4906		At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
hamlet@4953		Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
hamlet@4995		Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
hamlet@5039		Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
hamlet@5084		Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
hamlet@5136		For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
hamlet@5188		Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
hamlet@5240		Well ratified by law and heraldry,
hamlet@5276		Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
hamlet@5325		Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
hamlet@5370		Against the which, a moiety competent
hamlet@5409		Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
hamlet@5452		To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
hamlet@5487		Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
hamlet@5538		And carriage of the article design'd,
hamlet@5577		His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@5626		Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
hamlet@5662		Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
hamlet@5707		Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
hamlet@5748		For food and diet, to some enterprise
hamlet@5787		That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
hamlet@5834		As it doth well appear unto our state--
hamlet@5875		But to recover of us, by strong hand
hamlet@5913		And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
hamlet@5959		So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
hamlet@6004		Is the main motive of our preparations,
hamlet@6045		The source of this our watch and the chief head
hamlet@6094		Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
hamlet@6138
hamlet@6139	BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
hamlet@6184		Well may it sort that this portentous figure
hamlet@6230		Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
hamlet@6279		That was and is the question of these wars.
hamlet@6324
hamlet@6325	HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
hamlet@6373		In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
hamlet@6416		A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
hamlet@6457		The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
hamlet@6507		Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
hamlet@6552		As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
hamlet@6601		Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
hamlet@6643		Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
hamlet@6689		Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
hamlet@6732		And even the like precurse of fierce events,
hamlet@6778		As harbingers preceding still the fates
hamlet@6819		And prologue to the omen coming on,
hamlet@6856		Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
hamlet@6901		Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
hamlet@6940		But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
hamlet@6985
hamlet@6986		[Re-enter Ghost]
hamlet@7004
hamlet@7005		I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
hamlet@7057		If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
hamlet@7099		Speak to me:
hamlet@7113		If there be any good thing to be done,
hamlet@7153		That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
hamlet@7196		Speak to me:
hamlet@7210
hamlet@7211		[Cock crows]
hamlet@7225
hamlet@7226		If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
hamlet@7268		Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
hamlet@7318		Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
hamlet@7357		Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
hamlet@7398		For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
hamlet@7451		Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
hamlet@7502
hamlet@7503	MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
hamlet@7552
hamlet@7553	HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
hamlet@7587
hamlet@7588	BERNARDO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7608
hamlet@7609	HORATIO	'Tis here!
hamlet@7628
hamlet@7629	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
hamlet@7650
hamlet@7651		[Exit Ghost]
hamlet@7665
hamlet@7666		We do it wrong, being so majestical,
hamlet@7704		To offer it the show of violence;
hamlet@7739		For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
hamlet@7777		And our vain blows malicious mockery.
hamlet@7816
hamlet@7817	BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
hamlet@7869
hamlet@7870	HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing
hamlet@7918		Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
hamlet@7957		The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
hamlet@8001		Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
hamlet@8049		Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
hamlet@8093		Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
hamlet@8135		The extravagant and erring spirit hies
hamlet@8175		To his confine: and of the truth herein
hamlet@8216		This present object made probation.
hamlet@8253
hamlet@8254	MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
hamlet@8301		Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
hamlet@8347		Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
hamlet@8391		The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
hamlet@8436		And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
hamlet@8486		The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
hamlet@8537		No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
hamlet@8585		So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
hamlet@8627
hamlet@8628	HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
hamlet@8679		But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
hamlet@8724		Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
hamlet@8771		Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
hamlet@8813		Let us impart what we have seen to-night
hamlet@8855		Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
hamlet@8894		This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
hamlet@8939		Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
hamlet@8986		As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
hamlet@9030
hamlet@9031	MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
hamlet@9085		Where we shall find him most conveniently.

hamlet@9154	ACT I
hamlet@9160
hamlet@9161
hamlet@9162
hamlet@9163	SCENE II	A room of state in the castle.
hamlet@9203
hamlet@9204
hamlet@9205		[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
hamlet@9252		POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
hamlet@9301		and Attendants]
hamlet@9318
hamlet@9319	KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
hamlet@9379		The memory be green, and that it us befitted
hamlet@9425		To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
hamlet@9476		To be contracted in one brow of woe,
hamlet@9514		Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
hamlet@9561		That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
hamlet@9603		Together with remembrance of ourselves.
hamlet@9644		Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
hamlet@9691		The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
hamlet@9738		Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
hamlet@9781		With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
hamlet@9821		With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
hamlet@9872		In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
hamlet@9917		Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
hamlet@9959		Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
hamlet@10004		With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
hamlet@10050		Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
hamlet@10097		Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
hamlet@10136		Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
hamlet@10182		Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
hamlet@10226		Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
hamlet@10271		He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
hamlet@10318		Importing the surrender of those lands
hamlet@10358		Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
hamlet@10402		To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
hamlet@10449		Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
hamlet@10496		Thus much the business is: we have here writ
hamlet@10542		To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
hamlet@10583		Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
hamlet@10626		Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
hamlet@10670		His further gait herein; in that the levies,
hamlet@10716		The lists and full proportions, are all made
hamlet@10762		Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
hamlet@10804		You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
hamlet@10846		For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
hamlet@10891		Giving to you no further personal power
hamlet@10932		To business with the king, more than the scope
hamlet@10980		Of these delated articles allow.
hamlet@11014		Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
hamlet@11063
hamlet@11064
hamlet@11065	CORNELIUS	|
hamlet@11077		|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
hamlet@11127	VOLTIMAND	|
hamlet@11139
hamlet@11140
hamlet@11141	KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
hamlet@11195
hamlet@11196		[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@11230
hamlet@11231		And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
hamlet@11276		You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
hamlet@11323		You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
hamlet@11364		And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
hamlet@11419		That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
hamlet@11464		The head is not more native to the heart,
hamlet@11507		The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
hamlet@11549		Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
hamlet@11595		What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
hamlet@11629
hamlet@11630	LAERTES	My dread lord,
hamlet@11653		Your leave and favour to return to France;
hamlet@11697		From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
hamlet@11746		To show my duty in your coronation,
hamlet@11783		Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
hamlet@11825		My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
hamlet@11874		And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
hamlet@11923
hamlet@11924	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
hamlet@11988
hamlet@11989	LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
hamlet@12049		By laboursome petition, and at last
hamlet@12086		Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
hamlet@12127		I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
hamlet@12168
hamlet@12169	KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
hamlet@12227		And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
hamlet@12270		But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
hamlet@12312
hamlet@12313	HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
hamlet@12373
hamlet@12374	KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
hamlet@12433
hamlet@12434	HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
hamlet@12484
hamlet@12485	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
hamlet@12542		And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
hamlet@12592		Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
hamlet@12630		Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
hamlet@12670		Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
hamlet@12722		Passing through nature to eternity.
hamlet@12759
hamlet@12760	HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
hamlet@12792
hamlet@12793	QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,
hamlet@12818		Why seems it so particular with thee?
hamlet@12857
hamlet@12858	HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
hamlet@12910		'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
hamlet@12954		Nor customary suits of solemn black,
hamlet@12992		Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
hamlet@13033		No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
hamlet@13073		Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
hamlet@13114		Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
hamlet@13164		That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
hamlet@13210		For they are actions that a man might play:
hamlet@13255		But I have that within which passeth show;
hamlet@13299		These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
hamlet@13346
hamlet@13347	KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
hamlet@13412		To give these mourning duties to your father:
hamlet@13459		But, you must know, your father lost a father;
hamlet@13507		That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
hamlet@13559		In filial obligation for some term
hamlet@13595		To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
hamlet@13637		In obstinate condolement is a course
hamlet@13675		Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
hamlet@13721		It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
hamlet@13764		A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
hamlet@13804		An understanding simple and unschool'd:
hamlet@13845		For what we know must be and is as common
hamlet@13888		As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
hamlet@13928		Why should we in our peevish opposition
hamlet@13969		Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
hamlet@14017		A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
hamlet@14063		To reason most absurd: whose common theme
hamlet@14106		Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
hamlet@14154		From the first corse till he that died to-day,
hamlet@14202		'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
hamlet@14250		This unprevailing woe, and think of us
hamlet@14290		As of a father: for let the world take note,
hamlet@14336		You are the most immediate to our throne;
hamlet@14379		And with no less nobility of love
hamlet@14414		Than that which dearest father bears his son,
hamlet@14461		Do I impart toward you. For your intent
hamlet@14502		In going back to school in Wittenberg,
hamlet@14542		It is most retrograde to our desire:
hamlet@14580		And we beseech you, bend you to remain
hamlet@14620		Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

hamlet@14868
hamlet@14869	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
hamlet@14920		Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
hamlet@14960		This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
hamlet@15003		Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
hamlet@15048		No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
hamlet@15094		But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
hamlet@15142		And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,

hamlet@15261	HAMLET	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
hamlet@15312		Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
hamlet@15349		Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
hamlet@15388		His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
hamlet@15435		How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
hamlet@15477		Seem to me all the uses of this world!
hamlet@15517		Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
hamlet@15561		That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
hamlet@15614		Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
hamlet@15663		But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
hamlet@15712		So excellent a king; that was, to this,
hamlet@15753		Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
hamlet@15798		That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
hamlet@15844		Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
hamlet@15891		Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
hamlet@15937		As if increase of appetite had grown
hamlet@15975		By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
hamlet@16021		Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
hamlet@16075		A little month, or ere those shoes were old
hamlet@16120		With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
hamlet@16168		Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
hamlet@16213		O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
hamlet@16263		Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
hamlet@16314		My father's brother, but no more like my father
hamlet@16363		Than I to Hercules: within a month:
hamlet@16400		Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
hamlet@16444		Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
hamlet@16487		She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
hamlet@16531		With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

hamlet@16980	MARCELLUS	My good lord--
hamlet@17005

hamlet@17056		But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
hamlet@17103
hamlet@17104	HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.
hamlet@17148

hamlet@17192		Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
hamlet@17234		To make it truster of your own report

hamlet@17604
hamlet@17605	HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
hamlet@17661		Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
hamlet@17708		Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

hamlet@18039

hamlet@18258		Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
hamlet@18296		This marvel to you.
hamlet@18317
hamlet@18318	HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.
hamlet@18354
hamlet@18355	HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
hamlet@18404		Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
hamlet@18445		In the dead vast and middle of the night,
hamlet@18488		Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
hamlet@18539		Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
hamlet@18574		Appears before them, and with solemn march
hamlet@18618		Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
hamlet@18667		By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
hamlet@18712		Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
hamlet@18767		Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
hamlet@18806		Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
hamlet@18851		In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
hamlet@18889		And I with them the third night kept the watch;
hamlet@18938		Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
hamlet@18983		Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
hamlet@19033		The apparition comes: I knew your father;
hamlet@19076		These hands are not more like.
hamlet@19108
hamlet@19109	HAMLET	But where was this?
hamlet@19136
hamlet@19137	MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
hamlet@19192
hamlet@19193	HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?
hamlet@19225
hamlet@19226	HORATIO	My lord, I did;
hamlet@19250		But answer made it none: yet once methought
hamlet@19295		It lifted up its head and did address
hamlet@19334		Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
hamlet@19377		But even then the morning cock crew loud,
hamlet@19420		And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
hamlet@19463		And vanish'd from our sight.
hamlet@19493
hamlet@19494	HAMLET	'Tis very strange.
hamlet@19520
hamlet@19521	HORATIO	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
hamlet@19572		And we did think it writ down in our duty
hamlet@19615		To let you know of it.
hamlet@19639
hamlet@19640	HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
hamlet@19691		Hold you the watch to-night?

hamlet@19965
hamlet@19966	HORATIO	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
hamlet@20014
hamlet@20015	HAMLET	What, look'd he frowningly?
hamlet@20050
hamlet@20051	HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
hamlet@20103
hamlet@20104	HAMLET	Pale or red?
hamlet@20124
hamlet@20125	HORATIO	Nay, very pale.
hamlet@20149

hamlet@20322
hamlet@20323	HAMLET	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

hamlet@20502	HAMLET	                  His beard was grizzled--no?

hamlet@20622

hamlet@20730	HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,

hamlet@20826		And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
hamlet@20869		If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
hamlet@20913		Let it be tenable in your silence still;
hamlet@20955		And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
hamlet@20996		Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
hamlet@21038		I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
hamlet@21085		Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
hamlet@21131		I'll visit you.
hamlet@21148

hamlet@21503
hamlet@21504
hamlet@21505	SCENE III	A room in Polonius' house.
hamlet@21542
hamlet@21543
hamlet@21544		[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]
hamlet@21573
hamlet@21574	LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
hamlet@21621		And, sister, as the winds give benefit
hamlet@21661		And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
hamlet@21701		But let me hear from you.
hamlet@21728
hamlet@21729	OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
hamlet@21756
hamlet@21757	LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
hamlet@21808		Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
hamlet@21847		A violet in the youth of primy nature,
hamlet@21887		Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
hamlet@21932		The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
hamlet@21982
hamlet@21983	OPHELIA	       No more but so?
hamlet@22014
hamlet@22015	LAERTES	Think it no more;
hamlet@22041		For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
hamlet@22084		In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
hamlet@22131		The inward service of the mind and soul
hamlet@22172		Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
hamlet@22218		And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
hamlet@22260		The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
hamlet@22304		His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
hamlet@22353		For he himself is subject to his birth:
hamlet@22394		He may not, as unvalued persons do,
hamlet@22431		Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
hamlet@22477		The safety and health of this whole state;
hamlet@22521		And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
hamlet@22569		Unto the voice and yielding of that body
hamlet@22611		Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
hamlet@22666		It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
hamlet@22708		As he in his particular act and place
hamlet@22747		May give his saying deed; which is no further
hamlet@22794		Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
hamlet@22839		Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
hamlet@22886		If with too credent ear you list his songs,
hamlet@22931		Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
hamlet@22981		To his unmaster'd importunity.
hamlet@23013		Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
hamlet@23057		And keep you in the rear of your affection,
hamlet@23102		Out of the shot and danger of desire.
hamlet@23141		The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
hamlet@23180		If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
hamlet@23219		Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
hamlet@23266		The canker galls the infants of the spring,
hamlet@23311		Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
hamlet@23355		And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
hamlet@23396		Contagious blastments are most imminent.
hamlet@23438		Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
hamlet@23479		Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
hamlet@23527
hamlet@23528	OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
hamlet@23581		As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
hamlet@23629		Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
hamlet@23669		Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
hamlet@23714		Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
hamlet@23761		Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
hamlet@23809		And recks not his own rede.
hamlet@23838
hamlet@23839	LAERTES	O, fear me not.
hamlet@23863		I stay too long: but here my father comes.
hamlet@23907

hamlet@24064		The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
hamlet@24109		And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
hamlet@24164		And these few precepts in thy memory
hamlet@24202		See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
hamlet@24252		Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
hamlet@24293		Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
hamlet@24336		Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
hamlet@24388		Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
hamlet@24435		But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
hamlet@24480		Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
hamlet@24528		Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
hamlet@24569		Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
hamlet@24614		Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
hamlet@24658		Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
hamlet@24710		Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
hamlet@24750		But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
hamlet@24796		For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
hamlet@24836		And they in France of the best rank and station
hamlet@24885		Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
hamlet@24935		Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
hamlet@24972		For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
hamlet@25016		And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
hamlet@25060		This above all: to thine ownself be true,
hamlet@25103		And it must follow, as the night the day,
hamlet@25146		Thou canst not then be false to any man.
hamlet@25188		Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

hamlet@25578
hamlet@25579	OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@25638
hamlet@25639	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
hamlet@25676		'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
hamlet@25716		Given private time to you; and you yourself
hamlet@25761		Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
hamlet@25814		If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
hamlet@25850		And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
hamlet@25896		You do not understand yourself so clearly
hamlet@25939		As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
hamlet@25983		What is between you? give me up the truth.
hamlet@26027
hamlet@26028	OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
hamlet@26080		Of his affection to me.
hamlet@26105
hamlet@26106	LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
hamlet@26166		Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
hamlet@26207		Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
hamlet@26254
hamlet@26255	OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
hamlet@26308
hamlet@26309	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
hamlet@26369		That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
hamlet@26418		Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
hamlet@26472		Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
hamlet@26519		Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
hamlet@26562
hamlet@26563	OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
hamlet@26612		In honourable fashion.
hamlet@26636
hamlet@26637	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
hamlet@26694
hamlet@26695	OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
hamlet@26754		With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
hamlet@26796
hamlet@26797	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
hamlet@26855		When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
hamlet@26900		Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
hamlet@26948		Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
hamlet@26995		Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
hamlet@27038		You must not take for fire. From this time
hamlet@27082		Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
hamlet@27128		Set your entreatments at a higher rate
hamlet@27168		Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
hamlet@27212		Believe so much in him, that he is young
hamlet@27254		And with a larger tether may he walk
hamlet@27292		Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
hamlet@27333		Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
hamlet@27381		Not of that dye which their investments show,
hamlet@27428		But mere implorators of unholy suits,
hamlet@27467		Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
hamlet@27511		The better to beguile. This is for all:
hamlet@27552		I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
hamlet@27604		Have you so slander any moment leisure,
hamlet@27645		As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
hamlet@27693		Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.

hamlet@28537		But to my mind, though I am native here
hamlet@28578		And to the manner born, it is a custom
hamlet@28618		More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
hamlet@28668		This heavy-headed revel east and west
hamlet@28707		Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
hamlet@28754		They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
hamlet@28804		Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
hamlet@28844		From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
hamlet@28896		The pith and marrow of our attribute.
hamlet@28935		So, oft it chances in particular men,
hamlet@28974		That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
hamlet@29021		As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
hamlet@29071		Since nature cannot choose his origin--
hamlet@29112		By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
hamlet@29151		Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
hamlet@29201		Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
hamlet@29246		The form of plausive manners, that these men,
hamlet@29293		Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
hamlet@29336		Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
hamlet@29381		Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
hamlet@29428		As infinite as man may undergo--
hamlet@29462		Shall in the general censure take corruption
hamlet@29508		From that particular fault: the dram of eale
hamlet@29554		Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
hamlet@29595		To his own scandal.

hamlet@29816		Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
hamlet@29854		Thou comest in such a questionable shape
hamlet@29896		That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
hamlet@29947		King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
hamlet@29988		Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
hamlet@30029		Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
hamlet@30073		Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
hamlet@30121		Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
hamlet@30159		Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
hamlet@30201		To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
hamlet@30245		That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
hamlet@30293		Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
hamlet@30336		Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
hamlet@30382		So horridly to shake our disposition
hamlet@30420		With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
hamlet@30468		Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
hamlet@30517
hamlet@30518		[Ghost beckons HAMLET]
hamlet@30542
hamlet@30543	HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,
hamlet@30586		As if it some impartment did desire
hamlet@30623		To you alone.
hamlet@30638
hamlet@30639	MARCELLUS	                  Look, with what courteous action
hamlet@30700		It waves you to a more removed ground:
hamlet@30740		But do not go with it.
hamlet@30764
hamlet@30765	HORATIO	No, by no means.
hamlet@30790
hamlet@30791	HAMLET	It will not speak; then I will follow it.

hamlet@30841	HORATIO	Do not, my lord.
hamlet@30866
hamlet@30867	HAMLET	                  Why, what should be the fear?
hamlet@30922		I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
hamlet@30960		And for my soul, what can it do to that,
hamlet@31002		Being a thing immortal as itself?
hamlet@31037		It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
hamlet@31079
hamlet@31080	HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
hamlet@31136		Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
hamlet@31176		That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
hamlet@31218		And there assume some other horrible form,
hamlet@31262		Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
hamlet@31310		And draw you into madness? think of it:
hamlet@31351		The very place puts toys of desperation,
hamlet@31393		Without more motive, into every brain
hamlet@31432		That looks so many fathoms to the sea
hamlet@31471		And hears it roar beneath.
hamlet@31499
hamlet@31500	HAMLET	It waves me still.
hamlet@31526		Go on; I'll follow thee.
hamlet@31552
hamlet@31553	MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.
hamlet@31590

hamlet@31656
hamlet@31657	HAMLET	My fate cries out,
hamlet@31683		And makes each petty artery in this body
hamlet@31725		As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
hamlet@31763		Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
hamlet@31805		By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
hamlet@31856		I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

hamlet@32649
hamlet@32650	Ghost	 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
hamlet@32703
hamlet@32704	HAMLET	What?
hamlet@32717
hamlet@32718	Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,
hamlet@32750		Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
hamlet@32796		And for the day confined to fast in fires,
hamlet@32840		Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
hamlet@32888		Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
hamlet@32937		To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
hamlet@32978		I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
hamlet@33021		Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
hamlet@33072		Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
hamlet@33130		Thy knotted and combined locks to part
hamlet@33170		And each particular hair to stand on end,
hamlet@33213		Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
hamlet@33255		But this eternal blazon must not be
hamlet@33292		To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
hamlet@33342		If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
hamlet@33385
hamlet@33386	HAMLET	O God!
hamlet@33400
hamlet@33401	Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
hamlet@33451
hamlet@33452	HAMLET	Murder!
hamlet@33467
hamlet@33468	Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
hamlet@33514		But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
hamlet@33558
hamlet@33559	HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
hamlet@33614		As meditation or the thoughts of love,
hamlet@33654		May sweep to my revenge.
hamlet@33680
hamlet@33681	Ghost	I find thee apt;
hamlet@33704		And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
hamlet@33751		That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
hamlet@33794		Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
hamlet@33845		'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
hamlet@33891		A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
hamlet@33940		Is by a forged process of my death
hamlet@33976		Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
hamlet@34020		The serpent that did sting thy father's life
hamlet@34066		Now wears his crown.
hamlet@34088
hamlet@34089	HAMLET	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
hamlet@34127
hamlet@34128	Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
hamlet@34178		With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
hamlet@34232		O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
hamlet@34277		So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
hamlet@34318		The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
hamlet@34363		O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
hamlet@34404		From me, whose love was of that dignity
hamlet@34445		That it went hand in hand even with the vow
hamlet@34490		I made to her in marriage, and to decline
hamlet@34533		Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
hamlet@34578		To those of mine!
hamlet@34597		But virtue, as it never will be moved,
hamlet@34637		Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
hamlet@34685		So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
hamlet@34729		Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
hamlet@34767		And prey on garbage.
hamlet@34789		But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
hamlet@34835		Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
hamlet@34881		My custom always of the afternoon,
hamlet@34917		Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
hamlet@34955		With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
hamlet@34996		And in the porches of my ears did pour
hamlet@35036		The leperous distilment; whose effect
hamlet@35075		Holds such an enmity with blood of man
hamlet@35115		That swift as quicksilver it courses through
hamlet@35161		The natural gates and alleys of the body,
hamlet@35204		And with a sudden vigour doth posset
hamlet@35242		And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
hamlet@35285		The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
hamlet@35332		And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
hamlet@35373		Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
hamlet@35422		All my smooth body.
hamlet@35443		Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
hamlet@35486		Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
hamlet@35536		Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
hamlet@35577		Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
hamlet@35614		No reckoning made, but sent to my account
hamlet@35657		With all my imperfections on my head:
hamlet@35696		O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
hamlet@35738		If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
hamlet@35781		Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
hamlet@35818		A couch for luxury and damned incest.
hamlet@35857		But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
hamlet@35897		Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
hamlet@35944		Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
hamlet@35991		And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
hamlet@36037		To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
hamlet@36086		The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
hamlet@36129		And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
hamlet@36170		Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

hamlet@36368		But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
hamlet@36408		Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
hamlet@36456		In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
hamlet@36498		Yea, from the table of my memory
hamlet@36532		I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
hamlet@36574		All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
hamlet@36625		That youth and observation copied there;
hamlet@36667		And thy commandment all alone shall live
hamlet@36709		Within the book and volume of my brain,
hamlet@36750		Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!

hamlet@36820		O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!

hamlet@36905		That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
hamlet@36955		At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
hamlet@36999
hamlet@37000		[Writing]

hamlet@39978		How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
hamlet@40020		As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
hamlet@40063		To put an antic disposition on,
hamlet@40096		That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
hamlet@40145		With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
hamlet@40192		Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,

hamlet@41249
hamlet@41250	REYNALDO	                  My lord, I did intend it.
hamlet@41303
hamlet@41304	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
hamlet@41367		Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
hamlet@41413		And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
hamlet@41465		What company, at what expense; and finding
hamlet@41509		By this encompassment and drift of question
hamlet@41554		That they do know my son, come you more nearer
hamlet@41602		Than your particular demands will touch it:
hamlet@41647		Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
hamlet@41700		As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
hamlet@41746		And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
hamlet@41794
hamlet@41795	REYNALDO	Ay, very well, my lord.
hamlet@41828

hamlet@41973		What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank

hamlet@42063		But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
hamlet@42108		As are companions noted and most known
hamlet@42148		To youth and liberty.
hamlet@42171
hamlet@42172	REYNALDO	As gaming, my lord.
hamlet@42201
hamlet@42202	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
hamlet@42265		Drabbing: you may go so far.
hamlet@42295
hamlet@42296	REYNALDO	My lord, that would dishonour him.
hamlet@42340
hamlet@42341	LORD POLONIUS	'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
hamlet@42402		You must not put another scandal on him,
hamlet@42444		That he is open to incontinency;
hamlet@42478		That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
hamlet@42537		That they may seem the taints of liberty,
hamlet@42580		The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
hamlet@42621		A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
hamlet@42657		Of general assault.
hamlet@42678
hamlet@42679	REYNALDO	But, my good lord,--
hamlet@42709
hamlet@42710	LORD POLONIUS	Wherefore should you do this?
hamlet@42754
hamlet@42755	REYNALDO	Ay, my lord,
hamlet@42777		I would know that.
hamlet@42797
hamlet@42798	LORD POLONIUS	                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
hamlet@42859		And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
hamlet@42897		You laying these slight sullies on my son,
hamlet@42941		As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
hamlet@43002		Your party in converse, him you would sound,
hamlet@43048		Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
hamlet@43092		The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
hamlet@43137		He closes with you in this consequence;
hamlet@43178		'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
hamlet@43227		According to the phrase or the addition
hamlet@43268		Of man and country.
hamlet@43289
hamlet@43290	REYNALDO	Very good, my lord.
hamlet@43319
hamlet@43320	LORD POLONIUS	And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
hamlet@43383		about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
hamlet@43430		something: where did I leave?
hamlet@43461
hamlet@43462	REYNALDO	At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
hamlet@43522		and 'gentleman.'
hamlet@43540
hamlet@43541	LORD POLONIUS	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
hamlet@43598		He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
hamlet@43638		I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
hamlet@43677		Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
hamlet@43733		There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
hamlet@43782		There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
hamlet@43827		'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
hamlet@43868		Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
hamlet@43904		See you now;
hamlet@43918		Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
hamlet@43968		And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
hamlet@44008		With windlasses and with assays of bias,
hamlet@44050		By indirections find directions out:
hamlet@44088		So by my former lecture and advice,
hamlet@44125		Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
hamlet@44171
hamlet@44172	REYNALDO	My lord, I have.
hamlet@44198
hamlet@44199	LORD POLONIUS	                  God be wi' you; fare you well.
hamlet@44262
hamlet@44263	REYNALDO	Good my lord!
hamlet@44286
hamlet@44287	LORD POLONIUS	Observe his inclination in yourself.
hamlet@44338
hamlet@44339	REYNALDO	I shall, my lord.
hamlet@44366
hamlet@44367	LORD POLONIUS	And let him ply his music.
hamlet@44408
hamlet@44409	REYNALDO	Well, my lord.
hamlet@44433
hamlet@44434	LORD POLONIUS	Farewell!
hamlet@44458
hamlet@44459		[Exit REYNALDO]
hamlet@44476
hamlet@44477		[Enter OPHELIA]
hamlet@44494
hamlet@44495		How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
hamlet@44533
hamlet@44534	OPHELIA	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
hamlet@44590
hamlet@44591	LORD POLONIUS	With what, i' the name of God?
hamlet@44636
hamlet@44637	OPHELIA	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
hamlet@44684		Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
hamlet@44729		No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
hamlet@44774		Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
hamlet@44816		Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
hamlet@44867		And with a look so piteous in purport
hamlet@44906		As if he had been loosed out of hell
hamlet@44944		To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
hamlet@44987
hamlet@44988	LORD POLONIUS	Mad for thy love?
hamlet@45020
hamlet@45021	OPHELIA	                  My lord, I do not know;
hamlet@45071		But truly, I do fear it.
hamlet@45097
hamlet@45098	LORD POLONIUS	What said he?
hamlet@45126
hamlet@45127	OPHELIA	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
hamlet@45177		Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
hamlet@45221		And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
hamlet@45267		He falls to such perusal of my face
hamlet@45304		As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
hamlet@45345		At last, a little shaking of mine arm
hamlet@45384		And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
hamlet@45430		He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
hamlet@45472		As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
hamlet@45512		And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
hamlet@45558		And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
hamlet@45604		He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
hamlet@45649		For out o' doors he went without their helps,
hamlet@45696		And, to the last, bended their light on me.
hamlet@45741
hamlet@45742	LORD POLONIUS	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
hamlet@45799		This is the very ecstasy of love,
hamlet@45834		Whose violent property fordoes itself
hamlet@45873		And leads the will to desperate undertakings
hamlet@45919		As oft as any passion under heaven
hamlet@45955		That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
hamlet@45999		What, have you given him any hard words of late?
hamlet@46049
hamlet@46050	OPHELIA	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
hamlet@46101		I did repel his fetters and denied
hamlet@46137		His access to me.
hamlet@46156
hamlet@46157	LORD POLONIUS	                  That hath made him mad.
hamlet@46213		I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
hamlet@46260		I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
hamlet@46311		And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
hamlet@46363		By heaven, it is as proper to our age
hamlet@46402		To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
hamlet@46444		As it is common for the younger sort
hamlet@46482		To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
hamlet@46528		This must be known; which, being kept close, might
hamlet@46580		move
hamlet@46586		More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

hamlet@46751		GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants]
hamlet@46782
hamlet@46783	KING CLAUDIUS	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
hamlet@46841		Moreover that we much did long to see you,
hamlet@46885		The need we have to use you did provoke
hamlet@46926		Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
hamlet@46971		Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
hamlet@47012		Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
hamlet@47054		Resembles that it was. What it should be,
hamlet@47097		More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
hamlet@47151		So much from the understanding of himself,
hamlet@47195		I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
hamlet@47235		That, being of so young days brought up with him,
hamlet@47286		And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
hamlet@47336		That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
hamlet@47384		Some little time: so by your companies
hamlet@47424		To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
hamlet@47469		So much as from occasion you may glean,
hamlet@47510		Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
hamlet@47560		That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
hamlet@47599
hamlet@47600	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
hamlet@47659		And sure I am two men there are not living
hamlet@47703		To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
hamlet@47751		To show us so much gentry and good will
hamlet@47792		As to expend your time with us awhile,
hamlet@47832		For the supply and profit of our hope,
hamlet@47872		Your visitation shall receive such thanks
hamlet@47915		As fits a king's remembrance.
hamlet@47946
hamlet@47947	ROSENCRANTZ	Both your majesties
hamlet@47979		Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
hamlet@48026		Put your dread pleasures more into command
hamlet@48070		Than to entreaty.
hamlet@48089
hamlet@48090	GUILDENSTERN	                  But we both obey,
hamlet@48139		And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
hamlet@48185		To lay our service freely at your feet,
hamlet@48226		To be commanded.
hamlet@48244
hamlet@48245	KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
hamlet@48304
hamlet@48305	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
hamlet@48365		And I beseech you instantly to visit
hamlet@48403		My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
hamlet@48446		And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
hamlet@48490
hamlet@48491	GUILDENSTERN	Heavens make our presence and our practises
hamlet@48548		Pleasant and helpful to him!

hamlet@48664		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@48682
hamlet@48683	LORD POLONIUS	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
hamlet@48740		Are joyfully return'd.
hamlet@48764
hamlet@48765	KING CLAUDIUS	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
hamlet@48825
hamlet@48826	LORD POLONIUS	Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
hamlet@48881		I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
hamlet@48917		Both to my God and to my gracious king:
hamlet@48958		And I do think, or else this brain of mine
hamlet@49002		Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
hamlet@49041		As it hath used to do, that I have found
hamlet@49083		The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
hamlet@49119
hamlet@49120	KING CLAUDIUS	O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
hamlet@49176
hamlet@49177	LORD POLONIUS	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
hamlet@49233		My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
hamlet@49282
hamlet@49283	KING CLAUDIUS	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
hamlet@49342
hamlet@49343		[Exit POLONIUS]
hamlet@49360
hamlet@49361		He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
hamlet@49407		The head and source of all your son's distemper.
hamlet@49457
hamlet@49458	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I doubt it is no other but the main;
hamlet@49510		His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
hamlet@49559
hamlet@49560	KING CLAUDIUS	Well, we shall sift him.
hamlet@49599
hamlet@49600		[Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@49651
hamlet@49652			   Welcome, my good friends!
hamlet@49683		Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
hamlet@49730
hamlet@49731	VOLTIMAND	Most fair return of greetings and desires.
hamlet@49784		Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
hamlet@49825		His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
hamlet@49869		To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
hamlet@49910		But, better look'd into, he truly found
hamlet@49951		It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
hamlet@49999		That so his sickness, age and impotence
hamlet@50040		Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
hamlet@50086		On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
hamlet@50129		Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
hamlet@50171		Makes vow before his uncle never more
hamlet@50210		To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
hamlet@50259		Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
hamlet@50299		Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
hamlet@50347		And his commission to employ those soldiers,
hamlet@50393		So levied as before, against the Polack:
hamlet@50435		With an entreaty, herein further shown,
hamlet@50476
hamlet@50477		[Giving a paper]
hamlet@50495
hamlet@50496		That it might please you to give quiet pass
hamlet@50541		Through your dominions for this enterprise,
hamlet@50586		On such regards of safety and allowance
hamlet@50627		As therein are set down.
hamlet@50653
hamlet@50654	KING CLAUDIUS	It likes us well;
hamlet@50686		And at our more consider'd time well read,
hamlet@50730		Answer, and think upon this business.
hamlet@50769		Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
hamlet@50819		Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
hamlet@50868		Most welcome home!
hamlet@50888
hamlet@50889		[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
hamlet@50923
hamlet@50924	LORD POLONIUS	                  This business is well ended.
hamlet@50985		My liege, and madam, to expostulate
hamlet@51022		What majesty should be, what duty is,
hamlet@51061		Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
hamlet@51109		Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
hamlet@51157		Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
hamlet@51203		And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
hamlet@51254		I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
hamlet@51295		Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
hamlet@51340		What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
hamlet@51383		But let that go.
hamlet@51401
hamlet@51402	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  More matter, with less art.
hamlet@51463
hamlet@51464	LORD POLONIUS	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
hamlet@51514		That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
hamlet@51563		And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
hamlet@51607		But farewell it, for I will use no art.
hamlet@51648		Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
hamlet@51693		That we find out the cause of this effect,
hamlet@51737		Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
hamlet@51779		For this effect defective comes by cause:
hamlet@51822		Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
hamlet@51873		I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
hamlet@51918		Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
hamlet@51957		Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
hamlet@52003
hamlet@52004		[Reads]
hamlet@52013
hamlet@52014		'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
hamlet@52062		beautified Ophelia,'--
hamlet@52086		That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
hamlet@52140		a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
hamlet@52182
hamlet@52183		[Reads]
hamlet@52192
hamlet@52193		'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
hamlet@52237
hamlet@52238	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Came this from Hamlet to her?
hamlet@52283
hamlet@52284	LORD POLONIUS	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
hamlet@52343
hamlet@52344		[Reads]
hamlet@52353
hamlet@52354		'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
hamlet@52387		Doubt that the sun doth move;
hamlet@52418		Doubt truth to be a liar;
hamlet@52445		But never doubt I love.
hamlet@52470		'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
hamlet@52515		I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
hamlet@52561		I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
hamlet@52612		'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
hamlet@52652		this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
hamlet@52686		This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
hamlet@52734		And more above, hath his solicitings,
hamlet@52773		As they fell out by time, by means and place,
hamlet@52820		All given to mine ear.
hamlet@52844
hamlet@52845	KING CLAUDIUS	But how hath she
hamlet@52876		Received his love?
hamlet@52896
hamlet@52897	LORD POLONIUS	                  What do you think of me?
hamlet@52954
hamlet@52955	KING CLAUDIUS	As of a man faithful and honourable.
hamlet@53006
hamlet@53007	LORD POLONIUS	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
hamlet@53070		When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
hamlet@53115		As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
hamlet@53157		Before my daughter told me--what might you,
hamlet@53202		Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
hamlet@53246		If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
hamlet@53287		Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
hamlet@53332		Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
hamlet@53375		What might you think? No, I went round to work,
hamlet@53424		And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
hamlet@53467		'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
hamlet@53511		This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
hamlet@53561		That she should lock herself from his resort,
hamlet@53608		Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
hamlet@53649		Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
hamlet@53696		And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
hamlet@53738		Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
hamlet@53778		Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
hamlet@53822		Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
hamlet@53871		Into the madness wherein now he raves,
hamlet@53911		And all we mourn for.
hamlet@53934
hamlet@53935	KING CLAUDIUS	Do you think 'tis this?
hamlet@53973
hamlet@53974	QUEEN GERTRUDE	It may be, very likely.
hamlet@54013
hamlet@54014	LORD POLONIUS	Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
hamlet@54078		That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
hamlet@54117		When it proved otherwise?
hamlet@54144
hamlet@54145	KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I know.
hamlet@54176
hamlet@54177	LORD POLONIUS	[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
hamlet@54227
hamlet@54228		Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
hamlet@54272		If circumstances lead me, I will find
hamlet@54311		Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
hamlet@54358		Within the centre.
hamlet@54378
hamlet@54379	KING CLAUDIUS	                  How may we try it further?
hamlet@54438
hamlet@54439	LORD POLONIUS	You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
hamlet@54502		Here in the lobby.
hamlet@54522
hamlet@54523	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  So he does indeed.
hamlet@54575
hamlet@54576	LORD POLONIUS	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
hamlet@54636		Be you and I behind an arras then;
hamlet@54672		Mark the encounter: if he love her not
hamlet@54712		And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
hamlet@54756		Let me be no assistant for a state,
hamlet@54793		But keep a farm and carters.
hamlet@54823
hamlet@54824	KING CLAUDIUS	We will try it.
hamlet@54854
hamlet@54855	QUEEN GERTRUDE	But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
hamlet@54924
hamlet@54925	LORD POLONIUS	Away, I do beseech you, both away:
hamlet@54974		I'll board him presently.
hamlet@55001
hamlet@55002		[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and
hamlet@55046		Attendants]
hamlet@55059
hamlet@55060		[Enter HAMLET, reading]
hamlet@55085
hamlet@55086			    O, give me leave:
hamlet@55110		How does my good Lord Hamlet?
hamlet@55141
hamlet@55142	HAMLET	Well, God-a-mercy.
hamlet@55168
hamlet@55169	LORD POLONIUS	Do you know me, my lord?
hamlet@55208
hamlet@55209	HAMLET	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
hamlet@55254
hamlet@55255	LORD POLONIUS	Not I, my lord.
hamlet@55285
hamlet@55286	HAMLET	Then I would you were so honest a man.
hamlet@55332
hamlet@55333	LORD POLONIUS	Honest, my lord!
hamlet@55364
hamlet@55365	HAMLET	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
hamlet@55424		one man picked out of ten thousand.
hamlet@55461
hamlet@55462	LORD POLONIUS	That's very true, my lord.
hamlet@55503
hamlet@55504	HAMLET	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
hamlet@55563		god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
hamlet@55607
hamlet@55608	LORD POLONIUS	I have, my lord.
hamlet@55639
hamlet@55640	HAMLET	Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
hamlet@55692		blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
hamlet@55742		Friend, look to 't.
hamlet@55763
hamlet@55764	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
hamlet@55828		daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
hamlet@55878		was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
hamlet@55927		truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
hamlet@55976		love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
hamlet@56024		What do you read, my lord?
hamlet@56052
hamlet@56053	HAMLET	Words, words, words.
hamlet@56081
hamlet@56082	LORD POLONIUS	What is the matter, my lord?
hamlet@56125
hamlet@56126	HAMLET	Between who?
hamlet@56146
hamlet@56147	LORD POLONIUS	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
hamlet@56204
hamlet@56205	HAMLET	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
hamlet@56261		that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
hamlet@56314		wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
hamlet@56360		plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
hamlet@56414		wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
hamlet@56466		though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
hamlet@56518		I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
hamlet@56571		yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
hamlet@56625		you could go backward.
hamlet@56649
hamlet@56650	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method
hamlet@56717		in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
hamlet@56764
hamlet@56765	HAMLET	Into my grave.
hamlet@56787
hamlet@56788	LORD POLONIUS	Indeed, that is out o' the air.
hamlet@56834
hamlet@56835		[Aside]
hamlet@56844
hamlet@56845		How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
hamlet@56898		that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
hamlet@56951		could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
hamlet@57002		leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
hamlet@57049		meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
hamlet@57102		lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
hamlet@57150
hamlet@57151	HAMLET	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
hamlet@57210		more willingly part withal: except my life, except
hamlet@57262		my life, except my life.
hamlet@57288
hamlet@57289	LORD POLONIUS	Fare you well, my lord.
hamlet@57327
hamlet@57328	HAMLET	These tedious old fools!
hamlet@57360
hamlet@57361		[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
hamlet@57399
hamlet@57400	LORD POLONIUS	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
hamlet@57459
hamlet@57460	ROSENCRANTZ	[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!
hamlet@57506
hamlet@57507		[Exit POLONIUS]
hamlet@57524
hamlet@57525	GUILDENSTERN	My honoured lord!
hamlet@57556
hamlet@57557	ROSENCRANTZ	My most dear lord!
hamlet@57588
hamlet@57589	HAMLET	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
hamlet@57638		Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
hamlet@57697
hamlet@57698	ROSENCRANTZ	As the indifferent children of the earth.
hamlet@57752
hamlet@57753	GUILDENSTERN	Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
hamlet@57804		On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
hamlet@57850
hamlet@57851	HAMLET	Nor the soles of her shoe?
hamlet@57885
hamlet@57886	ROSENCRANTZ	Neither, my lord.
hamlet@57916
hamlet@57917	HAMLET	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
hamlet@57975		her favours?
hamlet@57989
hamlet@57990	GUILDENSTERN	'Faith, her privates we.
hamlet@58028
hamlet@58029	HAMLET	In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
hamlet@58086		is a strumpet. What's the news?
hamlet@58119
hamlet@58120	ROSENCRANTZ	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
hamlet@58182
hamlet@58183	HAMLET	Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
hamlet@58240		Let me question more in particular: what have you,
hamlet@58292		my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
hamlet@58344		that she sends you to prison hither?
hamlet@58382
hamlet@58383	GUILDENSTERN	Prison, my lord!
hamlet@58413
hamlet@58414	HAMLET	Denmark's a prison.
hamlet@58441
hamlet@58442	ROSENCRANTZ	Then is the world one.
hamlet@58477
hamlet@58478	HAMLET	A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
hamlet@58533		wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
hamlet@58586
hamlet@58587	ROSENCRANTZ	We think not so, my lord.
hamlet@58625
hamlet@58626	HAMLET	Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
hamlet@58683		either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
hamlet@58736		it is a prison.
hamlet@58753
hamlet@58754	ROSENCRANTZ	Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
hamlet@58813		narrow for your mind.
hamlet@58836
hamlet@58837	HAMLET	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
hamlet@58895		myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
hamlet@58948		have bad dreams.
hamlet@58966
hamlet@58967	GUILDENSTERN	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
hamlet@59027		substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
hamlet@59088
hamlet@59089	HAMLET	A dream itself is but a shadow.
hamlet@59128
hamlet@59129	ROSENCRANTZ	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
hamlet@59191		quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
hamlet@59234
hamlet@59235	HAMLET	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
hamlet@59292		outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
hamlet@59344		to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
hamlet@59392
hamlet@59393
hamlet@59394	ROSENCRANTZ	|
hamlet@59408		| We'll wait upon you.
hamlet@59432	GUILDENSTERN	|
hamlet@59447
hamlet@59448
hamlet@59449	HAMLET	No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
hamlet@59506		of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
hamlet@59559		man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
hamlet@59608		beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
hamlet@59662
hamlet@59663	ROSENCRANTZ	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
hamlet@59717
hamlet@59718	HAMLET	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
hamlet@59775		thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
hamlet@59825		too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
hamlet@59877		your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
hamlet@59929		deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
hamlet@59975
hamlet@59976	GUILDENSTERN	What should we say, my lord?
hamlet@60018
hamlet@60019	HAMLET	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
hamlet@60076		for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
hamlet@60130		which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
hamlet@60185		I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
hamlet@60236
hamlet@60237	ROSENCRANTZ	To what end, my lord?
hamlet@60271
hamlet@60272	HAMLET	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
hamlet@60330		the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
hamlet@60382		our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
hamlet@60434		love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
hamlet@60487		charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
hamlet@60535		whether you were sent for, or no?
hamlet@60570
hamlet@60571	ROSENCRANTZ	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
hamlet@60622
hamlet@60623	HAMLET	[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
hamlet@60680		love me, hold not off.
hamlet@60704
hamlet@60705	GUILDENSTERN	My lord, we were sent for.
hamlet@60745
hamlet@60746	HAMLET	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
hamlet@60799		prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
hamlet@60853		and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
hamlet@60902		wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
hamlet@60956		custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
hamlet@61008		with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
hamlet@61057		earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
hamlet@61109		excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
hamlet@61158		o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
hamlet@61211		with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
hamlet@61264		me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
hamlet@61319		What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
hamlet@61372		how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
hamlet@61421		express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
hamlet@61474		in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
hamlet@61525		world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
hamlet@61573		what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
hamlet@61626		me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
hamlet@61677		you seem to say so.
hamlet@61698
hamlet@61699	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
hamlet@61760
hamlet@61761	HAMLET	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
hamlet@61827
hamlet@61828	ROSENCRANTZ	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
hamlet@61891		lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
hamlet@61944		you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
hamlet@61996		coming, to offer you service.
hamlet@62027
hamlet@62028	HAMLET	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
hamlet@62088		shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
hamlet@62138		shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
hamlet@62190		sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
hamlet@62241		in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
hamlet@62291		lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
hamlet@62342		say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
hamlet@62394		for't. What players are they?
hamlet@62425
hamlet@62426	ROSENCRANTZ	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
hamlet@62487		tragedians of the city.
hamlet@62512
hamlet@62513	HAMLET	How chances it they travel? their residence, both
hamlet@62570		in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
hamlet@62619
hamlet@62620	ROSENCRANTZ	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
hamlet@62683		late innovation.
hamlet@62701
hamlet@62702	HAMLET	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
hamlet@62762		in the city? are they so followed?
hamlet@62798
hamlet@62799	ROSENCRANTZ	No, indeed, are they not.
hamlet@62837
hamlet@62838	HAMLET	How comes it? do they grow rusty?
hamlet@62879
hamlet@62880	ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
hamlet@62943		there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
hamlet@62995		that cry out on the top of question, and are most
hamlet@63046		tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
hamlet@63093		fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
hamlet@63146		call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
hamlet@63198		goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
hamlet@63242
hamlet@63243	HAMLET	What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
hamlet@63302		they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
hamlet@63349		longer than they can sing? will they not say
hamlet@63395		afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
hamlet@63449		players--as it is most like, if their means are no
hamlet@63501		better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
hamlet@63552		exclaim against their own succession?
hamlet@63591
hamlet@63592	ROSENCRANTZ	'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
hamlet@63657		the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
hamlet@63702		controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
hamlet@63753		for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
hamlet@63807		cuffs in the question.
hamlet@63831
hamlet@63832	HAMLET	Is't possible?
hamlet@63854
hamlet@63855	GUILDENSTERN	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
hamlet@63917
hamlet@63918	HAMLET	Do the boys carry it away?
hamlet@63952
hamlet@63953	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
hamlet@64019
hamlet@64020	HAMLET	It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
hamlet@64077		Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
hamlet@64131		my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hamlet@64179		hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
hamlet@64230		'Sblood, there is something in this more than
hamlet@64277		natural, if philosophy could find it out.
hamlet@64320
hamlet@64321		[Flourish of trumpets within]
hamlet@64352
hamlet@64353	GUILDENSTERN	There are the players.
hamlet@64389
hamlet@64390	HAMLET	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
hamlet@64449		come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
hamlet@64500		and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
hamlet@64552		lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
hamlet@64603		must show fairly outward, should more appear like
hamlet@64654		entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
hamlet@64705		uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
hamlet@64749
hamlet@64750	GUILDENSTERN	In what, my dear lord?
hamlet@64786
hamlet@64787	HAMLET	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
hamlet@64842		southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
hamlet@64883
hamlet@64884		[Enter POLONIUS]
hamlet@64902
hamlet@64903	LORD POLONIUS	Well be with you, gentlemen!
hamlet@64946
hamlet@64947	HAMLET	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hamlet@65005		hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
hamlet@65055		out of his swaddling-clouts.
hamlet@65085
hamlet@65086	ROSENCRANTZ	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
hamlet@65150		say an old man is twice a child.
hamlet@65184
hamlet@65185	HAMLET	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
hamlet@65244		mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
hamlet@65293		'twas so indeed.
hamlet@65311
hamlet@65312	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you.
hamlet@65360
hamlet@65361	HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you.
hamlet@65402		When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
hamlet@65440
hamlet@65441	LORD POLONIUS	The actors are come hither, my lord.
hamlet@65492
hamlet@65493	HAMLET	Buz, buz!
hamlet@65510
hamlet@65511	LORD POLONIUS	Upon mine honour,--
hamlet@65545
hamlet@65546	HAMLET	Then came each actor on his ass,--
hamlet@65588
hamlet@65589	LORD POLONIUS	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
hamlet@65653		comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
hamlet@65699		historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
hamlet@65752		comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
hamlet@65804		poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
hamlet@65853		Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
hamlet@65901		liberty, these are the only men.
hamlet@65935
hamlet@65936	HAMLET	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
hamlet@66000
hamlet@66001	LORD POLONIUS	What a treasure had he, my lord?
hamlet@66048
hamlet@66049	HAMLET	Why,
hamlet@66061		'One fair daughter and no more,
hamlet@66094		The which he loved passing well.'
hamlet@66129
hamlet@66130	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Still on my daughter.
hamlet@66175
hamlet@66176	HAMLET	Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
hamlet@66220
hamlet@66221	LORD POLONIUS	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
hamlet@66287		that I love passing well.
hamlet@66314
hamlet@66315	HAMLET	Nay, that follows not.
hamlet@66345
hamlet@66346	LORD POLONIUS	What follows, then, my lord?
hamlet@66389
hamlet@66390	HAMLET	Why,
hamlet@66402		'As by lot, God wot,'
hamlet@66425		and then, you know,
hamlet@66446		'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
hamlet@66489		the first row of the pious chanson will show you
hamlet@66539		more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
hamlet@66584
hamlet@66585		[Enter four or five Players]
hamlet@66615
hamlet@66616		You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
hamlet@66667		to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
hamlet@66719		friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
hamlet@66772		comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
hamlet@66824		lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
hamlet@66872		nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
hamlet@66923		altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
hamlet@66974		apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
hamlet@67027		ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
hamlet@67075		to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
hamlet@67129		we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
hamlet@67182		of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
hamlet@67227
hamlet@67228	First Player	What speech, my lord?
hamlet@67263
hamlet@67264	HAMLET	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
hamlet@67319		never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
hamlet@67372		play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
hamlet@67422		caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
hamlet@67473		it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
hamlet@67522		cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
hamlet@67573		digested in the scenes, set down with as much
hamlet@67620		modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
hamlet@67668		were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
hamlet@67717		savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
hamlet@67766		indict the author of affectation; but called it an
hamlet@67818		honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
hamlet@67869		much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
hamlet@67919		chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
hamlet@67967		thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
hamlet@68016		Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
hamlet@68069		at this line: let me see, let me see--
hamlet@68109		'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
hamlet@68160		it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
hamlet@68202		'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
hamlet@68245		Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
hamlet@68291		When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
hamlet@68334		Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
hamlet@68384		With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
hamlet@68425		Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
hamlet@68466		With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
hamlet@68516		Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
hamlet@68563		That lend a tyrannous and damned light
hamlet@68603		To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
hamlet@68655		And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
hamlet@68697		With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
hamlet@68745		Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
hamlet@68774		So, proceed you.
hamlet@68792
hamlet@68793	LORD POLONIUS	'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
hamlet@68861		good discretion.
hamlet@68879
hamlet@68880	First Player	'Anon he finds him
hamlet@68912		Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
hamlet@68962		Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
hamlet@69007		Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
hamlet@69047		Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
hamlet@69095		But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
hamlet@69142		The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
hamlet@69192		Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
hamlet@69237		Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
hamlet@69283		Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
hamlet@69333		Which was declining on the milky head
hamlet@69372		Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
hamlet@69420		So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
hamlet@69461		And like a neutral to his will and matter,
hamlet@69505		Did nothing.
hamlet@69519		But, as we often see, against some storm,
hamlet@69562		A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
hamlet@69611		The bold winds speechless and the orb below
hamlet@69656		As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
hamlet@69701		Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
hamlet@69750		Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
hamlet@69790		And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
hamlet@69831		On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
hamlet@69873		With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
hamlet@69921		Now falls on Priam.
hamlet@69942		Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
hamlet@69991		In general synod 'take away her power;
hamlet@70031		Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
hamlet@70081		And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
hamlet@70131		As low as to the fiends!'
hamlet@70158
hamlet@70159	LORD POLONIUS	This is too long.
hamlet@70191
hamlet@70192	HAMLET	It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
hamlet@70251		say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
hamlet@70302		sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
hamlet@70335
hamlet@70336	First Player	'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
hamlet@70395
hamlet@70396	HAMLET	'The mobled queen?'
hamlet@70423
hamlet@70424	LORD POLONIUS	That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
